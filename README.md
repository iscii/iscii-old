### Good morning 🐇
  
I'm Issac!  
I currently attend Stevens Institute of Technology and study Computer Science.  
My ambition is to be a part of a team that brings to fruition full-dive virtual reality, but for now I'm trying to survive school, find a place among society, and learn.  
  
Here's my portfolio website -- it's a work in progress.
